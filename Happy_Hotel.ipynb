              " 'when we made arrangements to attend a function at the nearby smart center the business manager suggested this hotel as convenient to their location and all the other dealerships on th it was also very reasonably priced so i called to verify vacancies for the date we would need a room and the room rate i was disappointed to hear that there were no king sized beds so we booked a fullqueen and there was no room service available i was pleased that the room rate was so low i havent stayed in a hotel for less than  since people were break dancing in parachute pants and i was happy to hear that there was a pizza place that delivered to the hotel and there were several nice restaurants nearby so i made the reservation a few days later i realized i had not received my confirmation email so to be on the safe side read because my other half insisted i called to make sure we had a room reserved it was a good thing i did read yes she was right because there was no record of my reservation in their computer and we did not have a room reserved despite my phone reservation the hotel manager was apologetic and quickly booked our room for the original quoted rate and sent me an email confirmation the night we checked in the gps eventually got us to the hotel but using the gps we had to drive through a residential subdivision ordinarily this would not be a big deal but this particular neighborhood has the largest speed bumps running across the road that i have ever seen seriously who needs speed bumps nearly a foot high who needs speed bumps a foot high every  feet for a quarter of a mile after slowly dragging the underside of our car over the third or fourth speed bump and gritting our teeth to the sound of metal and plastic grinding against these asphalt speed humps from hell i decided to turn back and find an alternate route the gps found one by going only one block further and it took us directly to the hotel parking lot without any speed bumps we arrived at pm we had changed time zones on the drive and the clerk quickly got us checked in we were disappointed to learn however that all of the nearby restaurants bar and grill places even the fast food joints cater specifically to the nearby businesses and as a result all of them and i mean all of them closed at  or pm because it was a week night even the pizza place closed early in short there are only  places within several miles to get any sort of food in this area after pm mc ds or burgerk so after hours of driving we had to get back in the car and head out for a paper sack full of drivethru deep fried greasy grub and a couple of cokes as for the room the room itself was small but not as small as some of the hotel rooms ive stayed in our room was probably around  x  the kitchenette is open to the room and there is a small table separating the spaces there is not enough room for a sofa but there was a recliner parked in the corner there was nothing in the room that wasnt functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty the ac appeared to be newer and worked fine the room was very clean but appeared somewhat dated we did not use the appliances except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker both of which worked fine the coffee was awful howeverbring your own if you can the bathroom was very clean and it had a full size tub with a shower the water pressure was good and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing oddly there was no shampoo in the shower and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that a guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the mcds drive thru the bed was very firm i had no problem but the wife didnt sleep well because it was too firm for her the pillows were the typical synthetic nonallergic spun polyester type which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee but if you use just one pillow your head will sink to the mattress which i suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers the next morning we looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room with the exception of the repeated high pitched angry screaming and squeals of someones precious little darling outside our door no i want the something or other as we packed up to check out we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway so noise was generally not a problem checkout was easy and took all of twenty seconds we were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there we probably will not stay there again because we honestly dont really have a reason to return to the area i think for a business professional who doesnt have an expense account and isnt reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however it would be a good inexpensive option as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before pm you double check your reservation bring your own pillow coffee and shampoo and you dont expect the four seasons or

the back of the hotel over the pool i had found a special for  a night through travelzoo and booked directly with the hotel the room was not large but was comfortable enough the rack rate on the door was  a small fridge was in the tv cabinet with drawers was convenient beds were great the bathroom was compact but there was a short shelf under the sink to use and a shelf over the toilet tub had a short shelf on the back and had a curved shower rail so it was fine nice showerhead tv reception would be great and then go snowy at times the small walkin closet did not have a light so i made good use of the flashlight i packed good size safe in the closet for my small laptop and small purse glass knobs on bath and closet door and a fullsize mirror on the closet door but we usually had it open i had to ask the housekeeper for robes and a foam pillow the second morning of our stay and she had this for us when we returned to our room later being a select guest was wonderful with coffee and hot tea every morning and we opted for a bagel or english muffin  each that kept us going until lunch later in the day a few times napkinssilverware was not provided and on two mornings the bagels were old tough and rock hard only complaint we really had one day we ordered some snacks in the evening and room service brought them to us on a table in the room so we felt special we had a few desserts from morsels we had bought downstairs internet signal was weak and an ethernet bridge was provided i ended up using my data card i have which was faster we ate at roberts in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good staff and service was excellent from the bellmen checkinfront desk concierge maid room service and engineers staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted the hotel lobby is grand the roses changed several times during the week and the lobby floor shines immaculately  definitely impressive our room was very clean the bath rug was removed and missing a few days so we asked for another one we spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp we were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel and believed it was four diamond quality it cost us  plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from national airport you have to get in line to obtain a cab which can be confusing and  plus tip back from the omni through abes sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and i with luggage we were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior trip advisor reviews so that was no surprise we experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on everything was still handled quickly which impressed us despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways we loved the hotel and if returning to washington dc area would definitely stay here again at the omni shoreham we heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison the metro is close by and convenient to the omni we purchased smart trip cards  each at metro central about three stops from woodley park so it costs  to get there and i put on  for my card and  for my husbands card he is a senior so his fare rates were half price we still had some money left on the cards after two weeks you can go to the website metroopensdoorscom to get directions from woodley park to wherever you want to go which is convenient the smart trip cards also get you on some local area buses including the dc circulator that we used to get to georgetown we did the grayline double decker hop on and hop off tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel  you have two days to use your ticket and we loved this bus tour excellent and highly recommend it we liked it so much we did a sixhour tour on another day with grayline to go see mt vernon go to union station before  am to buy your ticket and board our first tour vendor we had tried on our second night was through royal trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight  it was a big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in a van another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was okay but not great like they had experienced before i would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night  and consider one with a guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in washington dc places we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood we tried the lebanese taverna on connecticut one night but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good  neither my husband or i would recommend going there and it was around person we tried the caf paridiso on connecticut ave the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on tripadvisor but were disappointed and would not return favorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel  open city caf across on calvert street petits plats around the block on connecticut ave is excellent  we ate there our last night order the floating island for dessert petits plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out we ordered chinese takeout once lunch specials and soup from the eddie cafe across on calvert but address says connecticut ave and were favorably impressed and recommend chipoltes is on calvert across the street too  good mexican food and guacamolechips for a reasonable price  we ate there several times we had mcdonalds a time or two that is on connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel the cvs pharmacy on connecticut has cookies chips sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel we bought items and sundries quite a few times at cvs which is conveniently located a dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby however there is a place in dupont circle that says they have the best cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs  we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting if you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes be sure to stop it is not far from the grayline hopon hopoff double decker tour bus stop in dupont circle our favorite place to eat in washington dc that we highly recommend worth the trip is the old ebbitt grill a historic landmark since  at  th st near the white house in washington  we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once  excellent food good prices and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area we also ate at fago de chao at  pennsylvania ave near the old post office tower it is a brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food  a treat but will run you person plus tax and tip we ate once at mccormick  schmidt on f street in washington which was very good we ate lunch once at ellas wood fired pizza which was good the chart house in alexandria was enjoyable with great food we also liked the buffet at the garden caf in the national gallery of art at th and constitution nw which filled us up for the afternoon activities one of the best maps we used was washington the nations capital that you can obtain from the park service at the white house visitors center we took several with us had some others but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around and we went back to get more the international spy museum is great and worth the price to visit be sure to see the fd roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin between the jefferson and lincoln memorials if you want some good bargains ladies will enjoy filenes basement to shop we explored alexandria and georgetown check out the canals there in georgetown as well as washington dc we even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the orangutans go across the o line which was amazing check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a white house tour the library of congress amazing and the bureau of engraving the omni shoreham is a quality hotel to experience and an excellent base to explore washington dc and the surrounding area a wonderful and memorable trip for us  the fall leaves made it even more spectacular',\n",

since since they were all so positive we were really looking forward to a great stay and we werent disappointed right from the start everything went smoothly with an efficient checkin and very friendly staff explaining how everything worked within  minutes of our arrival we were settled in our room on the third floor with our cases and hooking up our laptop to the free wifi our room was gorgeous and more spacious than other reviews had us believe the dcor was bertrendy all black white and silver with fashionthemed pictures on the walls there was also a massive hd flatscreen tv on the wall big and clear enough for me to watch without my glasses we had a queen sized bed so incredibly comfortable we wanted to bring it home with a nightstand and walllamp on each side there was also a long black desk with a leather and chrome office chair which was perfect for using our laptop and sorting out the spoils of our shopping trips there was a slim closet at the far end of the room beside the door containing an easy and free to use safe a mini ironing board and iron as others have said there isnt much room to hang up many of your clothes in there theres a rail maybe  wide but there are plenty of drawers in the desk and nightstands so there is plenty of storage room if you dont mind ironing or the odd crease there was also no light in the closet which was a little awkward as the light from the room didnt really permeate that far in then of course there was the coffeemaking station which i really loved we had to ask for extra creamer a few times but we just left a note requesting it with our tip for the person cleaning the room and there was never any problem last but not least there was the bathroom which was lovely i really liked the big shower especially yes its true that its hard to turn it on without getting your arm wet but just angle the shower head into the corner first and its not so bad besides youre about to have a shower and get wet anyway so theres no big deal right also really liked the big fluffy white towels and the gilchrist and soames toiletries within half an hour of checking in we were heading back out on to the streets to check out the area there are lots of little cafs and pizzerias in the area and if youre after a quiet little restaurant for dinner there are several within a  minute walk down th avenue some of the places in the area we would recommend are austins caf th ave between th and th streets for a cheap and cheerful breakfast malibu diner rd street just off th ave any time of day its open  rosas pizza on the corner of th street and th ave for a quick slice or restivo ristorante on the corner of nd street and th ave for a quiet romantic dinner at a reasonable price theres also a starbucks on th avenue near th street if like me you need your regular venti youre also very close to penn station and madison square garden and times square is only a  minute walk away the closest subway stops are on th avenue at th street the  line and th avenue also known as ave of the americas at rd street the f and m lines the closest liquor store which arent as easy to find as youd think is on th street near th ave but all the marketdeli type shops nearby sell beer if thats all youre after whole foods on th ave at th street is also worth a visit for a posher snack  their fruit salads are really good back at the hotel itself we couldnt have asked for better service our room was always cleaned impeccably while we were out we got the turndown service complete with chocolate and the next days weather forecast if we were still out at around pm and we were never disturbed when we had the do not disturb sign on the door when we were tired one night we asked if it would be ok to have takeout delivered to our room and they were more than happy for us to do that  they just rang up to the room when the delivery guy arrived and asked if it was ok to send him up we ended up doing that three times during our stay and there was never a problem the only thing that slightly annoyed me about the hotel was the room key swiping system in the lifts  you cant press the button for your floor until youve swiped your room key on a pad in the lift which sounds fine but it was a bit fiddly in reality and the anticipated green light sometimes didnt appear as quickly or easily as it should its ok if there are only a few people in the lift and everyone gives each other time and space to do it but it can be a bit difficult when there are a mass of people all squashing in together all wanting different floors and you only have a few seconds to swipe your card and press your button before you pass the lower floors still its a minor gripe we also checked out the rooftop bar one night you can only access it on the express elevator from the lobby and once theyve stamped your hand but theyll let you out at your floor on the way back down its a little expensive but no more so than most of the bars in manhattan and the view is wonderful especially of the empire state building most of the rooftop bar is enclosed in glass and plastic with fairylights and greenery decorating the space but there is also a small open area if you want to get some fresh air if youre staying at the hotel i would highly recommending checking it out one night if only for the view so in summary its an excellent hotel  very chic modern and relaxed with great staff gorgeous rooms and in a great location couldnt fault it if we go back to manhattan and we can get a good deal i would definitely stay there again so i hope they dont put their prices up too much thanks for a wonderful stay fashion ',\n",
